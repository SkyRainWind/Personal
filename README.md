# Personal
I am SkyRainWind, an undergraduate now majoring in computer science from Harbin Institute of Technology.

I used to be involved in Competitive Programming Contest as a contestant and awarded gold medals in both ICPC and CCPC. Find my own description [here](https://www.cnblogs.com/SkyRainWind/p/17836175.html).

Currently I am interested in deep inforcement learning and willing to give a deep look on its robustness, while struggling with college lessons and some unimportant contests.
